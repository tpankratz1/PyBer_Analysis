# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, asked that a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type be created. Then, they requested the creation of a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Lastly, they asked for a summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
